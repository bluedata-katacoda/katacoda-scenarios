To begin the application development, we will first need to create a directory called “HDP” or any directory name of your choice. This directory will house all the files and components necessary to create the application image. <br>

To create a directory, execute the following command:<br>
`mkdir ~/HDP`{{execute}}<br>

Navigate to the newly created directory:<br>
`cd ~/HDP`{{execute}}<br>

Next, we need to create a skeleton file structure. To do so execute the following command:

Now, we will create a folder called “centos” inside the empty image directory.
<br>Execute the following command to do so :
<br>`mkdir image`{{execute}}
<br>`mkdir ~/HDP/image/centos`{{execute}}

Execute the below command to list all the files and folders created

`ls -R`{{execute}}
