The next step is to create a Dockerfile. 
<br>

<strong>"A docker file is a text file that the Docker engine understands to automatically build an image by reading the file. The Dockerfile consists of all the commands a user would call to assemble the desired image."</strong>
<br>
<br>
Let’s go ahead and create a Dockerfile inside the newly created centos folder.
<br>
For your reference, we have already created a ready Dockerfile in the ~/test directory.We will copy that file into the centos folder using the following command:<br>

Delete the existing Dockerfile by executing the below command:
<br>`rm -rf ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/Dockerfile`{{execute}}
<br>

Copy the new Dockerfile into the centos folder using the following command:
<br>`cp ~/test/Dockerfile ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/`{{execute}}

Copy the updatePath.sh into the centos folder using the following command:
<br>`cp ~/test/updatePath.sh ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/`{{execute}}

Execute the following command to view the contents of the Dockerfile:<br>
`cat ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/Dockerfile`{{execute}}

<li>You will now see many commands populate your terminal. These are the commands you would use if you were to install your application manually on a host<br> 
<br><li>The first line of the Dockerfile determines what is the “base” image you will be using to install your application on<br>

<li>Blue Data provides their own base image, which you can use by simply adding the following command at the top of your Dockerfile: 
<br><b>FROM bluedata/centos7:latest</b><br>
You have ability to create your own base image.<br>
e.g: <b>FROM ubuntu:12.04</b>, ubuntu:12.04 is the base image used here.
<br>
<li>All the commands proceeding the base image, are the commands used to setup the application<br> 

<li>These files or commands will be setup on top of the base image from BlueData and will eventually compile into a .Bin file for use on the EPIC platform. 

Copy java8.sh file to centos directory<br> 
`cp ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/spark/configure_java8.sh ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/`{{execute}}

Copy jupyter file to centos directory<br>
`cp ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/spark/configure_jupyter.sh ~/Source/Spark/image/centos/`{{execute}}
