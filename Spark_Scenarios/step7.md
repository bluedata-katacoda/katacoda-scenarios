Let's see what you built.

Exit out of the workbench shell
<br>`exit`{{execute}}

The newly built application package (or bundle) is saved in the deliverables directory.
<br>`cd deliverables`{{execute}}
<br>`ls `{{execute}}

Make it an executable using the below command
<br>`chmod +x bdcatalog-centos7-bluedata-spark221-1.0.bin`{{execute}}

To make the new image appear in App Store
Copy the bin file to /srv/bluedata/catalog 

Go to App Store in the EPIC GUI and click on <b>Refresh </b>button to bring the image in to App Store.

Once the image appears on the App Store click on <b>Install </b> button to install the image.
